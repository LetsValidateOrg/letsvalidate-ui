          Growing up in Denver, Colorado, I'd often ask my parents if they'd let
          me call the NIST Telephone Time-of-Day Service in the nearby city of
          Boulder to hear the current time according to the atomic clocks.

          During my college years, friends rolled their eyes when they saw me
          calibrating my wristwatch with the atomic time on the University
          central servers. As I became deeply interested in Linux system
          adminstration, it was a near-certainty to find an NTP daemon running
          on any host I had root privs on.  I founded <a href="https://publicntp.org" target="_blank">PublicNTP</a> in 2008 based on a
          deeply-held belief that highly-accurate time data should be provided
          as an unrestricted public service, open to all systems on the
          Internet.
