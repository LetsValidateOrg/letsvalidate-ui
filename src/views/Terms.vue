        </p>

        <p><b>ARTICLE 3 DELIVERY</b></p>
        <p>

          YOU acknowledge and agree that the title to and ownership of the
          SERVICE and the intellectual property rights associated therewith are
          and remain the sole and exclusive property of Let's Validate and
          agents and/or licensors. Because Let's Validate’s mission is to expand
          NTP servers around the world, Let's Validate grants YOU a revocable
          license to allow modification of any open source applications and
          inclusion of the SERVICE in YOUR application.
        </p>
        <p><b>ARTICLE 5 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</b></p>
        <p>
          YOU expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the SERVICE is at YOUR
          sole risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SERVICE, and source code are provided "AS IS”, and on a best-
          effort basis, without warranty of any kind. Let's Validate does not,
          either expressed, implied or statutory, make any warranties, claims or
          representations with respect to the SERVICE, including, without
          limitation, warranties of quality, performance, merchantability, or
          fitness of use for a particular purpose, to the fullest extent
          allowable by law, unless explicitly stated otherwise in these Terms
          and Conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          YOU acknowledge that the quality of SERVICE may be affected by factors
          beyond Let's Validate’s control, including without limitation,
          improper network/server configurations, user error, and malicious
          third-party behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's Validate further does not represent or warrant that the SERVICE
          will always function uninterrupted or error-free. Let's Validate makes
          no warranty of limitations of service downtime or server availability.
        </p>

        <p>
          No oral or written information or advice given by Let's Validate or by
          any of its representatives, agents or resellers shall create a
          warranty.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because the SERVICE is offered free of charge, Let's Validate retains
          the right to deny YOU service at any time for any reason. If YOU
          request the service from the same IP address more frequently than
          every five (5) minutes, YOUR request will be denied.
        </p>

        <p>
          As some jurisdictions do not allow some of the exclusions or
          limitations as set forth above, some of these exclusions or
          limitations may not apply to YOU. If that is the case, the disclaimer
          of warranties shall be issued TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY
          APPLICABLE AND/OR EXISTING LAW.
        </p>

        <p><b>ARTICLE 6 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></p>
        <p>
          In no event shall Let's Validate be liable for any indirect,
          incidental, punitive, or consequential damages due to any possible
          inefficacy or deficiency in the quality of the SERVICE.
        </p>

        <p>
          In all other events, Let's Validate shall not be liable for any loss,
          damage, injury (including, to the full extent permitted by law and no
          further, personal injury or death), demand or expense, direct or
          indirect, resulting from any act or omission that can be attributed to
          Let's Validate, its directors, employees, agents, or any other cause
          and arising out of or in connection with the use of the SERVICE even
          if Let's Validate, its directors, employees, agents or resellers, have
          been advised of the possibility of such damages, arising out of the
          use, misuse, or inability to use the SERVICE.
        </p>

        <p>
          While it may be foreseeable that an inability to properly keep precise
          time may lead to consequential damages if incorporated into a computer
          system, representations of the precision of the service are AS IS and
          provided on a best effort basis, and any consequential and/or
          incidental damage resulting from lack of precision time is TOTALLY
          DISCLAIMED.
        </p>

        <p>
          As some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability as set
          forth above, some of these exclusions or limitations may not apply to
          YOU. If that is the case, the disclaimer of warranties shall be issued
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE AND/OR EXISTING LAW.
        </p>

        <p><b>ARTICLE 7 THIRD PARTY SERVICE</b></p>
        <p>
          YOU acknowledge and agree that the SERVICE interacts with Third Party
          Software, the operating system on its hosting servers, and the
          Internet. Title and ownership of Third Party Software and the
          intellectual property rights associated therewith are and remain the
          sole and exclusively property of the respective third party. Let's
          Validate makes no representations and warranties concerning the
          efficacy and functionality of the operating system on its hosting

          other data unrelated to the value the SERVICE provides. Let's Validate
          further warrants it does not sell YOUR consumer proprietary
          information, nor does Let's Validate distribute your consumer
          proprietary information to any third parties for any purposes other

          solely for the purpose of improving efficiency.

          affected provision.
        </p>

        <p><b>ARTICLE 11 WAIVER</b></p>
        <p>
          The failure by Let's Validate to exercise any right hereunder shall
          not operate as a waiver of Let's Validate’s rights to exercise such
